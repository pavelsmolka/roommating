New to Vagrant?
---------------
It's easy to set up your Vagrant development environment.

1. Install VirtualBox:   
   `$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox`   
   Or do whatever your OS needs to do to get VirtualBox.  
2. Install Vagrant: http://downloads.vagrantup.com/   
   Do not install Vagrant via Gem, it's not recommended.   

That's it. You are ready for the project installation.
